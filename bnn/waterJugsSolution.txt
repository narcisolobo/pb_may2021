Solution: 

Fill the 5-jug up completely. There will be, of course, 5 gallons in the 5-jug. 
You must fill all the gallons up to the top, otherwise you don't actually know how much you have.
 
Use the water from the 5-jug to fill up the 3-jug. 
You're left with 3 gallons in the 3-jug and 2 gallons in the 5-jug.
 
Pour out the 3-gallon jug. 
You're left with nothing in the 3-jug and 2 gallons in the 5-jug.
 
Transfer the water from the 5-jug to the three jug. 
You're left with 2 gallons in the 3-jug. And nothing in the 5-jug.
 
Fill up the 5-jug completely. You now have 2 gallons in the 3-jug and 5 in the 5-jug. 
This means that there is 1 gallon (3.8 L) of space left in the 3-jug.
 
Use the water from the 5-jug to fill up the 3-jug. 
Fill up the last gallon of space in the 3-jug with the water from the 5-jug. 
This leaves you with 3 gallons in the 3-jug, and 4 gallons in the 5-jug.
 
Fill the 3-jug completely with water. 
You now have 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water.
 
Transfer this water into the 5-jug. 
You now have nothing in the 3-jug, and 3 gallons (11.4 L) in the 5-jug.
 
Re-fill the 3-jug with water. 
You now have 3 gallons (11.4 L) in the 3-jug and 3 gallons in the 5-jug.
 
Fill the 5-jug with water from your 3-jug. 
You now have 1 gallon (3.8 L) in the 3-jug and 5 gallons (18.9 L) in the 5-jug. 
This is because, in the last step, you only had 2 gallons (7.6 L) of space left over, so you could only pour 2 gallons.
 
Pour out the 5-jug and refill it with your 1 gallon. 
You now have nothing in the 3-jug and 1 gallon in the 5-jug
 
Fill up the 3-jug. You now have 3 gallons (11.4 L) in the 3-jug and 1 in the 5-jug.
 
Transfer the 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water into the 5-jug to end up with 4 gallons (15.1 L). 
Simply pour over your three gallons into the 5-jug, which only had 1 gallon (3.8 L) in it previously. 1+3=4
